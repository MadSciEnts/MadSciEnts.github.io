# Unity VR Tests

There are a lot of issues that arise when creating VR content in Unity3d.
I was curious if some of these could be resolved with a custom toolset to allow for rapid development with a small team.

In that persuit, I created 'Kraken'.  A multi pronged procedural node graph system to generate games and levels.

It was derived from a node editor framework (https://github.com/Baste-RainGames/Node_Editor) which allowed for extending it to serve my needs.

These were meant to be designed in the editor and processed at runtime.

I added an asset management system that supported tagging and basic version control. Even if a level were designed with out of date assets, when the level was loaded it would utilize the latest published in the asset library.
Kraken also supported 'hot swapping' asset library locations at any time. this allowed for different asset 'collections' to be operated upon.  In this sense 'asset libraries' were very much like asset 'themes' as well.

Here is a quick video of the Kraken node based system dynamically restoring deleted or destroyed parts of the level scene hierarchy, based on the nodes in the graph.
If the nodes had all of their 'required' input conditions met, the connections would light up in the color of their asset type.
Cameras would connect to UI Panels. Ui Panels would connect to UI Managers to handle transitions, and so on.



The scene graph would be saved as a scriptable asset, loaded to a null transform within the scene as an 'anchor'.  The graph editor would look to find any graphs attached to the scene and allow you to view the graph and exectute it as requested.  Several versions or 'layers' could be saved on a single transform anchor node in a scene.  This would allow you to quickly iterate between scene graphs before comitting a graph for export as a versionable asset.  As many scene graph achors could be located in a scene as you need.  One achor scene graph for ui, one for layout, one for lighting, etc.  I also found it useful for layout prefab generation. Using a scene as a prefab 'factory' of sorts to generate versions of rooms or locations.  While also allowing quick iteration or hot swapping of sub prefab assets (like floor tiles, columns, lights, etc) to visually determine the best modular part to use in a larger whole.




If you'd like to try it out yourself, this is a git repo of an early vanilla Kraken.
It requires [Unity3d 2017](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)

Here and there, I tried to keep improving the toolset to support VR and other advancements.  VR integrations substantially evolved into what is now called XR.  My goal was to be able to rapidly prototype a multiplayer coop videogame that supported crossplay between Mobile, Console, PC, and VR(XR).  With full controller support.  Unfortunately (as with all things) work and 'life' got in the way.  

Along the way I attempted many experiments.  Dynamic level destruction, enemy armour destruction, goal based ai, etc.  All the while keeping an eye on optimization and ensuring frame rates were over 90fps.

While no longer supported, Kraken was able to allow me to prototype an idea within a day or two.  In that regard I consider it a limited success.
