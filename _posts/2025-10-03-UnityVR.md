# Unity VR Tests

There are a lot of issues that arise when creating VR content in Unity3d.
I was curious if some of these could be resolved with a custom toolset to allow for rapid development with a small team.

In that persuit, I created 'Kraken'.  A multi pronged procedural node graph system to generate games and levels.

These were meant to be designed in the editor and processed at runtime.

It included an asset management system that supported tagging.  Even if a level were designed with out of date assets, when the level was loaded it would utilize the latest published in the asset library.
Kraken also supported 'hot swapping' asset library locations.

Here is a quick video of the Kraken node based system dynamically restoring deleted or destroyed parts of the level scene hierarchy, based on the nodes in the graph.
If the nodes had all of their 'required' input conditions met, the connections would light up in the color of their asset type.
Cameras would connect to UI Panels. Ui Panels would connect to UI Managers to handle transitions, and so on.

Here and there, I kept updating the toolset to support VR.  My goal was to be able to rapidly prototype a multiplayer coop videogame that supported crossplay between Mobile, Console, PC, and VR. With full controller support.  Unfortunately (as with all things) work and 'life' got in the way.  VR integrations substantially evolved into what is now called XR.

Along the way I attempted many experiments.  Dynamic level destruction, goal based ai, etc.  All the while keeping an eye on optimization and ensuring frame rates were over 90fps.
