# Unity VR Tests

There are a lot of issues that arise when creating VR content in Unity3d.
I was curious if some of these could be resolved with a custom toolset to allow for rapid development with a small team.

In that persuit, I created 'Kraken'.  A multi pronged procedural node graph system to generate games and levels.

These were meant to be designed in the editor and processed at runtime.
