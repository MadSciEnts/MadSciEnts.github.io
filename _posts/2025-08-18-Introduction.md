While my day job has been primarily in VFX/Animation for the past 20+ years,
my hobby is exploring emerging technologies.

Indie Game Dev, VR, Holographic displays (both stereo 3d, and naked eye displays).

This blog is to serve as a bit of a development diary retrospective.

A place to gather my thoughts, findings and various ramblings.

Most of my personal game dev exploration has been in Unity3d.

I started looking into Unity as a development platform around 2008.

I had just caught the tail end of Microsoft's Indie Dev portal with XBox 360.
Microsoft had given indie devs the ability to deploy to their home consoles from a game engine called Torque (and later TorqueX).

Android phones were hitting the market.  And I wanted to see what they had to offer.
After a brief run with Shiva3D, I started exploring Unit3D (v2.x or v3.x).

Optimization was everything.

Keeping draw calls down to 12-15 (while Apple enjoyed 60+) was quite the challenge. But not impossible.

Between then, and now, I've continued on my explorations with Unity3D as it allowed for not just mobile, but also VR, stereo3d games, and later naked eye holographic displays.
Sometimes branching into UnrealEngine and Architectural Renders.  I try to explore it all.

These are some of my observations.
