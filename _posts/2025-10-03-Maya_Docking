Creating workflow tools and scripts in Maya is always a good way to meet impossible deadlines.
Using PyQT is often the preferred way of delivering useful user interfaces.
However this is often overkill when prototyping workflows and tools under a time crunch.
Fortunately Maya comes with it's own set of methods for interacting with scripts and the work scene.

Confirmation Dialog is one such way.
![confirm dialog](https://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/ENU/MayaCRE-Tech-Docs/gfx/confirmExample.gif)
```
cmds.confirmDialog( title='Confirm', message='Are you sure?', button=['Yes','No'], defaultButton='Yes', cancelButton='No', dismissString='No' )
```

There are limitations with Maya's dialogue windows.  You cannot interact with the work scene while these windows wait for your input.
They are great for forcing confirmation of a next process (as their name would suggest).
