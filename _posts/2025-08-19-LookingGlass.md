Looking Glass is a naked eye holographic display.
<https://lookingglassfactory.com/>

Stereographic 3d movies and films utilize 2 images.
One for the left eye, and one for the right eye.

Naked eye holographic displays are a bit more involved.
Instead of just 2 images, they use 48 images.

This is so that, no matter the angle you view the display from, each eye will perceive a different image.

One of the most interesting aspects of this technology, is how you can perceive reflections.

For example, if we have a render of a room. And we place a mirror in that room.

![Desktop View](/room_single.png){: w="256" h="256" }

You can see the perspective is slightly different. But it's also different for the mirror.

![Desktop View](/room.png){: w="256" h="256" }

The result, when viewed through the display, is a real sense of depth.

Of course, there are limits to just how much depth you can reliably perceive.

Just like in 3d movies, there is an optimal range for perception that the technology will support.

To push these tests a little bit further, I tried using an example scene with boats and sails.


![Desktop View](/ocean_single.png){: w="256" h="256" }


The sails provided a very clear upper most range (near clip).  While the ocean surface details and waves give us a nice baseline for the neutral point.
The ocean depths help us for a nice infinite depth (far clip).

And the final result.

This technology has lots of promise for medical or architectural displays.
But I also feel it would be great for product kiosks or advertisements.

To push it a bit further, I tried some tests with fur.
