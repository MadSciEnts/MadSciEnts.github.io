Looking Glass is a naked eye holographic display.

Stereographic 3d movies and films utilize 2 images.
One for the left eye, and one for the right eye.

Naked eye holographic displays are a bit more involved.
Instead of just 2 images, they use 48 images.

This is so that, no matter the angle you view the display from, each eye will perceive a different image.

One of the most interesting aspects of this technology, is how you can perceive reflections.

For example, if we have a render of a room. And we place a mirror in that room.

![Desktop View](/room.png){: w="256" h="256" }

![Desktop View](/room.gif){: w="256" h="256" }
