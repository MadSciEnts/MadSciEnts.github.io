Mad-Sci-Ents:

-The Maddening Science of Entertainment


I'm a 20+ yr veteran of the VFX/Animation industry.
In my spare time, I like to dabble in emerging technologies.
This site will cover some of those dabblings.

Starting in the early 2010's, I started getting into mobile game development.
Optimizing simple games to efficiently use the 12-15 draw calls, that android could handle.
Add the complication of multi-touch screens that weren't really multi-touch... And you've got a recipe for innovation.

Always up for a wild experiment or two.  Some, more successful than others.
I got into VR when it first came out. Starting with the DK2 and CV1, and moving onto the Rift and later PSVR, HTC Vive, etc.
One thing that always irked my soul, was performance pops and hickups.
I often explore ways to optimize and streamline VR experiences on lower end devices.
When you experience a constant framerate of 90-120+ (what I like to refer to as 'butter'), anything less really makes you wonder if anyone play tests their releases.
Poor VR experiences are what contributed to the poor adoption of the emerging technology.
Much the same way terrible stereoscopic work, contributed to the fall of stereo 3d TV's.
Bad experiences are easily forgotten.
Great experiences stay with you for life.
